# Fall 2021
## Student Projects 
Students are expected to complete a student project over the course of the semester. 
The student projects come from a number of open source projects in the industry, and these open source projects are providing mentors for the work. 
Student projects are more fully described on the [Student Projects](https://github.com/jhu-ospo-courses/JHU-EN.601.270/tree/main/Student%20Projects#student-projects) page.
