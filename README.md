## Open Source Software Engineering -- Semesters of Code I

The course will provide students a development experience focused on learning software engineering skills to deliver software at scale to a broad community of users associated with open source licensed projects. The class work will introduce students to ideas behind open source software with structured modules on recognizing and building healthy project structure, intellectual property basics, community & project governance, social and ethical concerns, and software economics.
The practical side of the course will engage and mentor students directly in OSI-licensed project communities to provide hands-on learning experiences of practices covered in the classroom modules, and team building experience working in the project.  

## Pre-requisites
* 601.220 Intermediate Programming
* 601.226 Data Structures

## Objectives  
* Understand software engineering and the difference between programming-in-the-small, and the tooling and process to support software engineering at scale
* Understand how liberally licensed, collaboratively developed software fits into the world of a professional programmer
* Gain real-world experience in programming-in-the-large in an open source software project community
* Be able to identify healthy open source projects and tools you can use in your software projects without compromising your work
* Be aware of the high-level community and business issues (ownership, licenses, non-profits, community development, culture) 
* Understand the basic framework for intellectual property that every professional developer needs to know

## Lectures
Lectures, presentations, and notes will be posted in [Lectures section](https://github.com/jhu-ospo-courses/JHU-EN.601.270/tree/main/Lectures#lectures-and-notes). 
Lectures will generally consist of notes and a presentation. 
The presentation will be posted as well. 
Required readings from the text books will be listed with the lectures. 
Occassionally published papers will be discussed. 
The papers's citations will be listed with the appropriate lecture (and the paper will be included on the course Blackboard site). 

## The Student Project
Students are expected to complete a student project over the course of the semester. 
The student projects come from a number of open source projects in the industry, and these open source projects are providing mentors for the work. 
Student projects are more fully described on the [Student Projects](https://github.com/jhu-ospo-courses/JHU-EN.601.270/tree/main/Student%20Projects#student-projects) page.
