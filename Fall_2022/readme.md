# Fall 2022
# Student Projects
Students will work on a student project through the semester to provide a real world example of the open source and engineering practices from class. 
Student projects have been developed by a set of mentors from a number real world open source licensed projects. 
Students will choose a project from the list below and apply for it by sending email to the instructor. 

## Open Source Student Projects 
1. [PASS Student Projects](https://github.com/jhu-ospo-courses/JHU-EN.601.270/tree/main/Fall_2022#pass-projects): PASS is the [Public Access Submission System](https://pass.jhu.edu/), a platform to assist researchers in complying with the access policies of their funders and institutions (e.g. NASA, CDC, NIH). While many federal agencies have policies that require research results to be made publicly accessible, the requirements to comply with these vary greatly from one agency to another. These heterogeneous processes for compliance have become burdensome for researchers and their institutions. For research that is funded by multiple agencies, it can be especially complicated to ensure compliance with each funder’s access policy.
1. [PowerShell Student Projects](https://github.com/jhu-ospo-courses/JHU-EN.601.270/tree/main/Fall_2022#microsoft-powershell-projects): Microsoft [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.
1. [Lutece Student Projects](https://github.com/jhu-ospo-courses/JHU-EN.601.270/tree/main/Fall_2022#lutece-projects): [Lutece](https://lutece-platform.github.io/) is a powerful Java™ based Content Management Framework developed by the [City of Paris](https://lutece.paris.fr/lutece/), and adopted in many places (including the St. Francis Neighborhood Center in Baltimore).
